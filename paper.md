# Summary 

Flares are unmistakeable signs of stellar magnetic activity and a key to our understanding
of stellar properties and evolution. They are violent explosions that penetrate 
all layers of a starâ€™s atmosphere, and enhance the overall stellar
brightness by up to orders of magnitude within minutes. We observe them as distinct
signatures in the light curves $-$ repeated measurements of stellar brightness over 
uninterrupted periods of time $-$ of most stars. Their rates and energies provide
unique insights to the nature of the stars that produce them. 

Space missions like Kepler [@koch2010], K2 [@howell2014], and TESS [@ricker2014] have
 collected light curves of hundreds of thousands of stars, for time spans ranging several weeks
to multiple years, and continue to gather high-cadence, high-precision
data. In response to the steady growth of this scientific treasury, and to aid
astronomers who require accurately characterized flare samples for their research, 
we developed `AltaiPony`. `AltaiPony` is a toolbox for statistical flares 
studies on photometric time series from these missions, including flare search 
and characterization, injection-recovery diagnostics, and statistical analysis 
of flare frequency distributions along with extensive 
documentation and Jupyter-based tutorials.

# Functionality

`AltaiPony` is based on `lightkurve` [@lightkurve2018], and can access most 
features that are implemented in it, which makes it an accessible tool for new 
users who are already familiar with the software. `lightkurve` is a versatile
Python package for light curve handling that includes visualization, basic tools for  
de-trending, transit detection, and asteroseismology. It is the most widely 
used software for handling Kepler, K2, and TESS data. `AltaiPony` derives its main
class `FlareLightCurve` directly from `lightkurve`'s `LightCurve` and its mission-specific
versions.

`AltaiPony` was designed to be used by astronomers as a one stop shop 
solution with adaptations of common de-trending tools like the Savitzky-Golay filter
from `lightkurve.flatten()`, and K2SC [@aigrain2016; @k2sc2016] that are tailored 
to preserve flare signal, and remove astrophysical and instrumental variability. 
The design also allows users to add their own custom de-trending functions to `AltaiPony`.

After de-trending `FlareLightCurve.find_flares()` returns the occurrence times of
 all flares found in the residual light curve using a adjustable iterative 
sigma-clipping procedure [@davenport2016], along with amplitude, duration, and relative
flare energy. 

As measured flare amplitudes and durations are different from their intrinsic properties 
due to various astrophysical and instrumental effects, `AltaiPony` features an 
injection-recovery pipeline for synthetic flares with visualization aids to quantify 
the cumulated effects introduced by light curve specific noise levels, time sampling,
 and the de-trending and flare finding procedure of choice. 

The frequencies $f$ of flares have been shown to follow a power law distribution in energy $E$:

\begin{equation}
f(>E) = \dfrac{\beta}{\alpha - 1}E^{-\alpha + 1},
\end{equation}

To estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and their respective uncertainties for a given sample
 of flares, `AltaiPony` includes a modified maximum likelihood estimator method 
[@maschberger2009] for $\alpha$ with a subsequent least-squares fit to $\beta$ with 
bootstrapped uncertainties, as well as a class based fully Bayesian framework [@wheatland2004] that 
incorporates both the power law nature of $f$, and the exponential flare waiting times 
to predict flare frequencies, and uses emcee [@emcee2013] to sample from the posterior distribution using 
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.

# Applications

`AltaiPony` has already been used in peer-reviewed publications that studied flares 
in K2 [@ilin2019; @ilin2020] and TESS [@ramsay2020] light curves, and remains under active development.
