# Summary

Why do we want to study flares in optical light curves?

# Statement of need


There are many light curves, and flare statistics is a growing field, so...
Kepler, K2, and TESS

lightkurve offer versatile light curve handling, and AltaiPony can access most its features, which makes it an accessible tool for new users.

AltaiPony is a toolbox for statistical flares studies on photometric time series 
from Kepler, K2, and TESS, including flare search and characterization, injection/recovery diagnostics, 
and statistical analysis of flare frequency distributions along with extensive documentation and tutorials.

`AltaiPony` was designed to be used by astronomical researchers as a one stop shop 
solution 

It has already been used in a number of scientific publications [@citation]
