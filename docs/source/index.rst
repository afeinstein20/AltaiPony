======================================================
Flare science in Kepler, K2 and TESS light curves
======================================================

**AltaiPony** finds flares in Kepler, K2, and TESS photometry. You can create a ``FlareLightCurve``, remove systematics and photometric variability, and search it for flares. 

K2 light curves are best de-trended using **k2sc_**. For TESS and Kepler we employ a Savitzky-Golay filter. You can use most methods from lightkurve_'s ``KeplerLightCurve`` and ``TessLightCurve`` classes. **AltaiPony** can be used to inject and recover synthetic flare signatures. Jump to the core class is here_. **AltaiPony** replaces the original Appaloosa_ (Davenport 2016).

Problems?
^^^^^^^^^

 Often, when something does not work in **AltaiPony** and this documentation is useless, troubleshooting can be done by diving into the extensive **lightkurve** docs_. Otherwise, you can always shoot Ekaterina an email_ or open an issue on GitHub_. Many foreseeable problems will be due to **AltaiPony** itself.
