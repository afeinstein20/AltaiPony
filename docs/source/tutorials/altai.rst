Finding Flares
=====

First you'll need a de-trended light curve (Find out how here_.). If you have a raw ``FlareLightCurve`` we can call ``rawflc``, for Kepler and TESS light curves use:

>>> flc = rawflc.detrend("savgol")

K2 is more difficult, and computationally intense, but doable with:

>>> flc = rawflc.detrend("k2sc")

Now you have a de-trended light curve ``flc``, and you can search it for flares:

>>> flc = flc.find_flares()

This will return the initial light curve with a new attribute - ``flares``, which is a DataFrame_ with the following columns:

* ``ampl_rec`` - recovered amplitude measured relative to the quiescent stellar flux
* ``ed_rec`` - recovered equivalent duration of the flare, that is, the are under the light curve with quiescent flux subtracted.
* ``ed_rec_err`` - the minimum uncertainty on equivalent duration derived from the uncertainty on the flare flux values (see `Davenport (2016)`_ for details, Eq. (2)).
* ``cstart, cstop, istart, istop, tstart, tstop`` - start and end of flare candidates in units of cadence, array index and actual time in days.
